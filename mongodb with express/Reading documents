now after inserting the documents now we will read the docs

const getData = async() =>{
   const data = await Biodata.find()
   console.log(data);
}
getData()

there are certain comparison operators which we can use to filter out our data more

const getData = async() =>{
   const data = await Biodata.find({age:{$gt:22}})
   console.log(data);
}
// here we will only get data with age value greater than 22;


Now there are logical operators like AND, OR NOR, etc

const getData = async(aged) =>{
   const data = await Biodata.find({$or:[{age:aged},{Address:"Bengal"}]}).select({name:1})
   console.log(data);
}
getData(22)

this is the syntax of or but all the otherr follow same syntax

now We can also sort the data we recieved in asc or desc order based on the fields

const getData = async(aged) =>{
   const data = await Biodata.find().sort("name : 1")
   console.log(data);
}
//1 means asc  , -1 means desc
