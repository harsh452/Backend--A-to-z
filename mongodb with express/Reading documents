now after inserting the documents now we will read the docs

const getData = async() =>{
   const data = await Biodata.find()
   console.log(data);
}
getData()

there are certain comparison operators which we can use to filter out our data more

const getData = async() =>{
   const data = await Biodata.find({age:{$gt:22}})
   console.log(data);
}

// here we will only get data with age value greater than 22;
