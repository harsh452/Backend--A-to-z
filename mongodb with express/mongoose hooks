we can fire any function after or before certain task has been completed in db

userSchema.post('save',(doc,next)=>{
    console.log('new user was created',doc);
    next()
})

this method is triggered when a data is saved in the database

userSchema.pre('save',function(next){
    console.log('new user is about to be  created',this);
    next()
})
userSchema.pre method is triggered when a data is about to be saved in the database
we cannot use arrow function in  before save method because we need "this" keyword which will be used as instance of user data which is about to be saved in db


we need to use next() because it is a mongoose hook method therefore we need to use next() so that it can carry on to the next operations
